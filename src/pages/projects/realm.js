        The Real Estate Application and Listing Manager or R.E.A.L.M. is a
        computer science capstone project sponsored by the software management
        company, AppFolio. It is a web application which aggregates rental
        listing information from multiple internet listing services (ILS), such
        as Zillow and Apartments.com, and displays this information in both a
        table and map format, with search and filtering options to make it easy
        to find suitable rental housing. Users are also able to bookmark their
        listings to go back to them later, and are able to join roommate groups,
        which allows them to share listings with their roommates through email or
        text.

        which helped put the whole project together.
